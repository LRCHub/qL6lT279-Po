Right from the start I knew
we could never part
Something magic in the way
that you move
Oh what a shame
we could never feel the pain
That our past tried
to put in our view
This feeling it surrounds me,
ohh
Turning me around
'til I lose control
This feeling it surrounds me,
ohh
I can see the sun is shining
on your soul
So let's keep it gold, mm
Darling
we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mm
Darling
we got stories left to be told
Ok we got a new dawn, new day
Go and grab your suitcase
Same walk, new pace
Go on tie your shoe lace
Ain't got a lotta money,
but got a lotta time
So let's spend it
where it's sunny
Let us see what we can find
This feeling it surrounds me,
ohh
Turning me around
'til I lose control
This feeling it surrounds me,
ohh
I can see the sun is shining
on your soul
So let's keep it gold, mm
Darling
we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mm
Darling
we got stories left to be told
Let's keep it gold, mm
Darling
we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mm
Darling
we got stories left to be told
We don't need no money
To spread a little honey
We got all we need here
Just leave me where it's sunny
We don't need no money
To spread a little honey
We got all we need here, just
Just keep it gold, mm
Darling
we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mm
Darling
we got stories left to be told
Let's keep it gold, mm
Darling
we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mm
Darling
we got stories left to be told
